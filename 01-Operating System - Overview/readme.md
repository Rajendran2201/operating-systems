# Anatomy of Computer Systems

Computer systems are composed of hardware and software. They work together to solve computational problems.

- **Hardware:** The hardware deals with the mechanical, electrical, and electronic components of the computer system. The hardware of the computer is made of four components:
    - Input Devices
    - Output Devices
    - Storage Devices
    - Internal Components

- **Software:** The software deals with the internal processes of the computer. It is a set of instructions/programs used to drive or take control over the hardware. The software is classified into two types:
    - **Application Software:** It is used to solve specific problems. The programmers have to write every line of code related to the problem to keep track and control the machine operations. Examples: Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, Google Chrome.
    - **System Software:** Writing all the code of software for solving problems at all times was a tedious process. In order to tackle this issue, system software was used. System software is a common program intended to be used by all programmers to control the operations of the computer system. Present-day computers use many system programs as integral parts of them. They are often designed and developed by the manufacturer of the hardware for their respective computers and supplied along with the machine as inseparable components. System software is a preliminary tool or medium to simplify the programming environment and to enable efficient use of the hardware. It hides the details of how the hardware operates, thereby making the computer hardware relatively easy for an application programmer to use. System Software is a component of Computer Software that directly operates with Computer Hardware which has the work to control the Computerâ€™s Internal Functioning and also takes responsibility for controlling Hardware Devices such as Printers, Storage Devices, etc. Examples: Windows, MacOS, Linux, UNIX, etc.

## Introduction to Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) is an interface between hardware and software. It acts as an intermediate device between the user and the hardware. The operating system governs the control of equipment resources such as the processor, main memory, secondary storage, I/O devices, and different files. It hides the complexity of the hardware from the user and presents a simplified view of the computer system. An operating system is responsible for managing and controlling all the activities and sharing of computer resources. An operating system is a low-level software that includes all the basic functions like processor management, memory management, error detection, etc.

Examples:

| Operating System | Name |
| --- | --- |
| UNIX | MVS |
| MacOS | VMS |
| MS-DOS | VM |
| MS-Windows | Chicago |
| Mach | OS2 |

### Objectives of OS

- **Convenience:** An OS makes a computer more convenient to use by providing easy-to-use commands and graphical user interfaces (GUI).
- **Resource Management:** An OS allows computer system resources to be used efficiently and ensures good resource utilization efficiency.
- **Ability to Evolve:** An OS should be constructed to permit effective development, testing, and introduction of new system functions without interfering with service.

| Convenience | Efficiency |
| --- | --- |
| Ability to evolve | User friendly |
| Easy access | Resource manager |
| Control and monitor | Fair sharing of resources |

### Functions of OS

1. **Booting:** Booting is a process of starting the computer operating system to make it ready to work.
2. **Memory Management:** Managing memory allocation and deallocation to ensure efficient use of memory resources.
3. **Loading and Execution:** Loading programs into memory and executing them.
4. **Data Security:** Protecting data stored on the computer from illegal use, modification, or deletion.
5. **Disk Management:** Managing disk space and organizing stored files and folders.
6. **Process Management:** Managing processes and allocating CPU time to them.
7. **Device Controlling:** Controlling hardware devices attached to the computer using device drivers.
8. **Providing Interface:** Providing a user interface for interaction with the computer.
9. **I/O System Management:** Managing input and output operations between the computer and its peripherals.
10. **Networking:** Enabling communication and resource sharing over networks.

## Components of OS

The Operating Systems has two parts namely 

- **Kernel**
    - It is an active part of OS
    - It is the part of OS running at all the time
    - Kernel is a program which can interact with the hardware
    - Examples : Device drivers, DLL files, System files
- **Shell**
    - It is also called as Command Interpreter
    - It is a set of programs which interacts with the application programs.
    - It is responsible for the execution of instructions given to the OS

# Evolution of OS

The OS has been evolving ever since it was invented. The evolution of OS has been categorized into six types:

- [Serial Processing Systems](https://github.com/Rajendran2201/01-operating-systems/blob/main/Operating%20System%20-%20Overview/serial%20processing.md) 
- [Batch Processing Systems](https://github.com/Rajendran2201/01-operating-systems/blob/main/Operating%20System%20-%20Overview/batch%20processing%20system.md)
