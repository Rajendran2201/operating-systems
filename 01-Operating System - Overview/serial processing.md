# Serial Processing System

Before the 1950s, programmers interacted directly with computer hardware, as there was no operating system at that time. Instead, programs had to be written on punch cards.

To run a program, the following steps had to be followed:

- Type the program on punched cards.
- Convert the punched card into a card reader.
- Submit to the computing machine.
- If any errors occurred in the program, the error condition was indicated by lights.
- Examine the registers and main memory to identify the cause of the error.
- Debug the error and repeat the process.
- If there were no errors, the program ran successfully on the computing machine.
- The output could be printed using printers.

The programs were submitted to the machine one after the other. This method is called "Serial processing." It was difficult for users, took much time, and the next program had to wait for the completion of the previous one.

### Drawbacks of Serial Processing Systems

The two main problems in serial processing systems were as follows:

- **Scheduling:** The process of scheduling the jobs was not automated. The user had to schedule which program to run first.
- **Setup Time:** Serial processing systems took time to set up the punch cards into the computing machine.
